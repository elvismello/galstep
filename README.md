## About

This code uses the algorithm described in Springel, Di Matteo & Hernquist
(2005) for generating the initial conditions for a disk galaxy simulation
with the codes GADGET-2 or RAMSES (using the [DICE patch](https://bitbucket.org/vperret/dice/wiki/RAMSES%20simulation)), including 
a stellar disk, a gaseous disk, a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge. The
first two components follow an exponential density profile, and the last
two a Dehnen density profile with gamma=1 by default, corresponding to a 
Hernquist profile. You can check out the expressions in
[Ruggiero & Lima Neto (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1703.08550).

Some notes: this method fails to generate low mass halos (~10^10 solar
masses) in equilibrium, since the velocity distribution for these near
the center is strongly non gaussian. Secondly, if you run GADGET-2
without any gas cooling, the gaseous disk will gain lots of energy over
time due to the artificial viscosity, and will get a lot thicker. Lastly,
the gas component must me relaxed for a few hundred Myr to reach equilibrium
in case your simulation doesn't include radiative cooling. If it does,
relaxation will be a lot faster (a few tens of Myr at most).

About units: the value for the gravitational constant G used in this code
is such that the unit for length is 1.0 kpc, for mass 1.0e10 solar masses,
and for velocity 1.0 km/s. This is the default for GADGET-2, and works out
of the box in RAMSES with the DICE patch.


## Required libraries
 
* NumPy (python-numpy)
* SciPy (python-scipy)
* [pyGadgetReader](https://bitbucket.org/rthompson/pygadgetreader)
* h5py (only if you need the HDF5 file format, python-h5py)


## Usage

You can run `python galstep.py --help` to see the message below. Also please
check out the `galaxy_params.ini` file to see the available free parameters.

    usage: galstep.py [-h] [-cores CORES] [--force-yes] [--force-no] [--hdf5]
                      [-o init.dat] [-i params_galaxy.ini]
    
    Generates an initial conditions file for a galaxy simulation with halo,
    stellar disk, gaseous disk and bulge components.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -cores CORES          The number of cores to use during the potential
                            canculation. Make sure this number is a factor of
                            N_rho*N_z. Default is 1.
      --force-yes           Don't ask if you want to use the existing
                            potential_data.txt file. Useful for automating the
                            execution of the script.
      --force-no            Same as above, but with the opposite effect.
      --hdf5                Output initial conditions in HDF5 format.
      -o init.dat           The name of the output file.
      -i params_galaxy.ini  The name of the .ini file.
